# CTA-COVIDRidership
Python Data Structures &amp; Algorithms

This project uses two data sets that will be merged with Python Pandas. CTA_Ridership includes the daily number of rides train stop from January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2020 (each row is a different day and train stop). CTA_Station is a data set with TRUE/FALSE entries to match the train stops with their appropriate Line Color (i.e. the CTA Red Line). Some stations are included in more than one CTA Line and will have an additional row in the set.

This project answers the following questions in the attached Excel Files.
1. The total number of Station Entries for each year (2001 - 2020) at the Loyola Station
2. The total number of rides in February and March at the Loyola Station and a calculated estimation of the day Loyola University closed down based on the trends of this data.
3. The monthly ridership from 2001 to 2020 for each CTA Line (compiling all station ridership entries for each specific line)
4. The total number of entries and revenue gained for all stations and lines for the first 6 months of 2019 compared to the first 6 months of 2020

Output Excels for the given questions are as follows:
1. annual_ridership_Loyola1
2. annual_ridership_Loyola2
3. monthly_ridership
4. ridership_revenue
